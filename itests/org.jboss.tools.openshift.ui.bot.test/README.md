# OpenShift tooling integrations tests
This plugin contains OpenShift 3 tooling integrations tests. For execution of a specific tests see guidelines below.

## OpenShift 3 integration tests
Running OpenShift 3 integrations tests requires OpenShift 3 local cluster in CDK (https://developers.redhat.com/products/cdk/overview/). Online instances, like https://www.openshift.com, can be used too, but they are not tested. 
Note: tested with CDK 3.2.0.alpha.

#### Running OS tests from IDE
There are three suites for OpenShift 3 tests (full suite (OpenShift3BotTests), smoke suite (OpenShift3SmokeBotTests)) and stable suite (OpenShift3StableTests). To run OpenShift tests from IDE, perform following steps:
1. Install RedDeer to your IDE from update site: http://download.eclipse.org/reddeer/releases/latest (RedDeer is on DevStudio TP, RedDeer project repo URL: https://github.com/eclipse/reddeer)
2. Select desired suite (e.g. OpenShift3BotTests, OpenShift3SmokeBotTests, OpenShift3StableBotTests) and in its context menu select _Run As_ - _Run Configurations..._
3. In Run Configurations shell double click on RedDeer Test and a new RedDeer test run configuration for your suite is created
4. Select tab Argument and fill in following properties **with credentials** to VM arguments:
`-Dopenshift.server= -Dopenshift.username= -Dopenshift.password= -Dsecurestorage.password= -Dusage_reporting_enabled=false -Dopenshift.authmethod=basic`
for OpenShift tests is used basic authentication method with username/password by default.   
5. Confirm changes and run test suite.

#### Running OS tests from command line
For execution of OpenShift tests from command line you need to have installed maven. At first you need to build jbosstools-openshift repo with maven and disabled tests, e.g. `mvn clean install -DskipTests=true -DskipITests=true`. Then run in _org.jboss.tools.openshift.ui.bot.test_ plugin following command **with filled credentials and OpenShift server** with basic authentication. By default it is used OpenShift3StableBotTests tests suite. User can switch to different suite class by using profiles: `-Psmoke` (OpenShift3SmokeBotTests) or `-Pfull` (OpenShift3BotTests).
`mvn clean verify -PITests -Dopenshift.username= -Dopenshift.password= -Dsecurestorage.password= -Dopenshift.server= `

Or you can run ITests from jbosstools-openshift root folder with profile ITests, e.g. `mvn clean verify -PITests -Dopenshift.username= -Dopenshift.password= -Dsecurestorage.password= -Dopenshift.server= `.

You can also run a single test class. To utilize all advantages of RedDeer suite, be sure your test class is annotated with RunWith(RedDeerSuite.class) annotation. If you want to run a single test class instead of a test suite, replace argument -Dscope by argument -Dtest.
